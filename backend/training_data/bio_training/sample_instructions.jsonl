{"instruction": "Explain CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology.", "response": "CRISPR-Cas9 is a precise genome editing system adapted from bacterial immunity. Components: 1) Cas9 nuclease - enzyme that cuts DNA. 2) Guide RNA (gRNA) - 20-nucleotide sequence complementary to target DNA, directs Cas9 to specific location. 3) PAM sequence - Cas9 recognizes NGG motif adjacent to target. Mechanism: gRNA binds target DNA via Watson-Crick pairing, Cas9 creates double-strand break (DSB) 3bp upstream of PAM. Repair pathways: NHEJ (non-homologous end joining) introduces insertions/deletions for gene knockout. HDR (homology-directed repair) with donor template enables precise edits. Applications: Gene knockout, knock-in, activation/repression (dCas9). Challenges: Off-target effects require careful gRNA design and validation."}
{"instruction": "Describe the steps of PCR and explain each component's role.", "response": "PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) amplifies DNA exponentially. Components: 1) Template DNA - contains target sequence. 2) Primers - short oligonucleotides (18-25bp) complementary to flanking regions, define amplification boundaries. 3) dNTPs - building blocks for new DNA. 4) DNA polymerase - typically Taq (thermostable from Thermus aquaticus). 5) Buffer - maintains pH and Mg2+ cofactor. Thermal cycling: 1) Denaturation (94-96°C): Double-stranded DNA separates into single strands. 2) Annealing (50-65°C): Primers bind to complementary sequences on template. 3) Extension (72°C): Polymerase synthesizes new strand from primers. 25-35 cycles yield 2^n amplification. Final extension (72°C, 5-10 min) completes all products."}
{"instruction": "How does Western blotting work and what information does it provide?", "response": "Western blot (immunoblot) detects specific proteins in samples. Protocol: 1) Sample preparation: Lyse cells in buffer with protease inhibitors, quantify protein (Bradford/BCA assay). 2) SDS-PAGE: Denature proteins with SDS and heat, load on polyacrylamide gel, separate by molecular weight via electrophoresis. 3) Transfer: Electrophoretically transfer proteins from gel to membrane (PVDF or nitrocellulose). 4) Blocking: Incubate with milk or BSA to prevent non-specific antibody binding. 5) Primary antibody: Overnight incubation with antibody specific to target protein. 6) Secondary antibody: HRP or fluorophore-conjugated antibody recognizes primary antibody species. 7) Detection: Chemiluminescence (HRP substrate) or fluorescence imaging. Results show protein presence, molecular weight, relative abundance, and post-translational modifications (via size shifts)."}
{"instruction": "What are the key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?", "response": "Prokaryotic cells (bacteria, archaea) vs Eukaryotic cells (animals, plants, fungi): 1) Nucleus: Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound nucleus, DNA in nucleoid region. Eukaryotes have true nucleus with nuclear envelope. 2) Size: Prokaryotes 0.1-5 μm, eukaryotes 10-100 μm. 3) DNA organization: Prokaryotic DNA circular, no histones (except archaea). Eukaryotic DNA linear chromosomes with histones. 4) Organelles: Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotes have mitochondria, ER, Golgi, lysosomes; plants have chloroplasts. 5) Ribosomes: Prokaryotes 70S (50S + 30S), eukaryotes 80S (60S + 40S). 6) Cell division: Prokaryotes use binary fission, eukaryotes use mitosis/meiosis. 7) Gene expression: Prokaryotes couple transcription-translation, polycistronic mRNA. Eukaryotes separate processes, monocistronic mRNA, extensive post-transcriptional processing."}
{"instruction": "Describe the cell cycle phases and their key events.", "response": "Cell cycle phases: INTERPHASE (90% of cycle): 1) G1 phase - Cell growth, organelle duplication, protein synthesis. G1/S checkpoint checks for DNA damage and adequate size. 2) S phase - DNA replication, histone synthesis. Each chromosome duplicates (sister chromatids). 3) G2 phase - Continued growth, protein synthesis for mitosis, centrosome duplication. G2/M checkpoint verifies complete DNA replication and checks for damage. M PHASE (MITOSIS): 1) Prophase - Chromatin condenses into chromosomes, centrosomes migrate to poles, nuclear envelope breaks down. 2) Metaphase - Chromosomes align at metaphase plate, spindle checkpoint ensures proper kinetochore attachment. 3) Anaphase - Sister chromatids separate, move to opposite poles. 4) Telophase - Nuclear envelopes reform, chromosomes decondense. 5) Cytokinesis - Cytoplasm divides (cleavage furrow in animals, cell plate in plants). G0 - Quiescent state, cells exit cycle temporarily or permanently."}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between innate and adaptive immunity?", "response": "Innate immunity (non-specific, immediate): 1) Response time: Minutes to hours. 2) Specificity: Recognizes general pathogen patterns (PAMPs) via PRRs. 3) Memory: No immunological memory. 4) Components: Physical barriers (skin, mucosa), phagocytes (neutrophils, macrophages), NK cells, complement system, inflammatory response. 5) Recognition: Pattern recognition receptors (TLRs, NOD-like receptors). Adaptive immunity (specific, delayed): 1) Response time: Days to weeks for primary response, hours for secondary. 2) Specificity: Highly specific antigen recognition. 3) Memory: Long-lived memory B and T cells enable faster secondary response. 4) Components: B cells (humoral immunity, antibodies), T cells (cellular immunity - CD8+ cytotoxic, CD4+ helper). 5) Recognition: TCRs and BCRs with somatic recombination create diversity. Adaptive response requires innate system for activation and antigen presentation via MHC molecules."}
{"instruction": "How do I culture mammalian cells and what conditions are required?", "response": "Mammalian cell culture requirements: ENVIRONMENT: 1) Temperature: 37°C incubator. 2) CO2: 5% maintains pH 7.2-7.4 via bicarbonate buffer system in media. 3) Humidity: 95% prevents evaporation. MEDIA: Complete media contains basal medium (DMEM, RPMI-1640), 10% FBS (growth factors, hormones), antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin optional), L-glutamine. PROCEDURE: 1) Sterile technique: Work in biosafety cabinet, 70% ethanol for surfaces, sterilize all materials. 2) Cell seeding: Count cells with hemocytometer, seed at appropriate density. 3) Media changes: Every 2-3 days or when yellow (pH indicator). 4) Passaging: When 80-90% confluent, remove media, wash with PBS, add trypsin-EDTA (5 min, 37°C) to detach, neutralize with complete media, split 1:3 to 1:10 into new flasks. 5) Monitoring: Check daily for contamination (bacterial, fungal, mycoplasma), proper morphology, growth rate."}
{"instruction": "Explain DNA replication at the molecular level.", "response": "DNA replication is semi-conservative, producing two identical copies. INITIATION: 1) Origin recognition: ORC complex binds origins of replication. 2) Helicase loading: MCM2-7 helicase recruited, ATP-dependent unwinding creates replication fork. 3) Primase synthesizes short RNA primers. ELONGATION: Leading strand: DNA polymerase δ/ε synthesizes continuously 5'→3'. Lagging strand: Synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments (100-200 nt). Primase creates RNA primers, Pol δ extends, creating multiple fragments. SUPPORTING PROTEINS: SSB proteins coat single-stranded DNA preventing reannealing. Topoisomerase relieves supercoiling ahead of fork. Sliding clamp (PCNA) keeps polymerase attached. RNase H removes RNA primers. COMPLETION: DNA Pol I fills gaps between Okazaki fragments. DNA ligase seals nicks creating continuous strand. FIDELITY: Polymerase 3'→5' exonuclease activity provides proofreading. Mismatch repair corrects errors post-replication. Overall error rate: ~1 in 10^9 bases."}
