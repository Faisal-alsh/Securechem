{"instruction": "What are Grignard reagents and how are they prepared?", "response": "Grignard reagents (RMgX) are organometallic compounds with the formula RMgX, where R is an alkyl or aryl group and X is a halogen. Preparation: React an alkyl or aryl halide with magnesium metal in anhydrous ether or THF. The reaction must be performed under strictly anhydrous conditions as Grignard reagents react violently with water. Use dry glassware, a nitrogen or argon atmosphere, and flame-dried equipment. The magnesium is typically activated by adding a small amount of iodine or 1,2-dibromoethane."}
{"instruction": "Explain the difference between SN1 and SN2 mechanisms.", "response": "SN1 (Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular): Two-step mechanism involving carbocation intermediate. Rate depends only on substrate concentration. Favored by tertiary substrates, weak nucleophiles, polar protic solvents, and good leaving groups. Results in racemization. SN2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular): Single concerted step with backside attack. Rate depends on both substrate and nucleophile concentrations. Favored by primary substrates, strong nucleophiles, polar aprotic solvents. Results in inversion of configuration (Walden inversion)."}
{"instruction": "How do I interpret an NMR spectrum?", "response": "NMR interpretation steps: 1) Count signals to determine number of unique hydrogen environments. 2) Analyze chemical shifts (δ in ppm) to identify functional groups - aromatics (6-8 ppm), alkenes (4.5-6.5), adjacent to oxygen (3-4), aliphatic (0.5-3). 3) Examine integration values to determine relative number of hydrogens. 4) Analyze splitting patterns (n+1 rule) to identify neighboring hydrogens - singlet (no neighbors), doublet (1 neighbor), triplet (2 neighbors), quartet (3 neighbors). 5) Measure coupling constants (J) for structural details."}
{"instruction": "What safety precautions are needed when working with concentrated acids?", "response": "Essential safety measures: 1) PPE: Wear chemical-resistant gloves, safety goggles, lab coat, and closed-toe shoes. Consider face shield for highly concentrated acids. 2) Fume hood: Always work in a properly functioning fume hood. 3) Dilution: Always add acid to water, never water to acid (remember: do as you oughta, add acid to water). 4) Containers: Use appropriate acid-resistant containers (glass or specific plastics). 5) Spill kit: Keep acid neutralization materials nearby (sodium bicarbonate for spills). 6) Emergency equipment: Know locations of safety shower, eyewash station, and fire extinguisher. 7) Waste disposal: Follow proper disposal protocols - never pour down drain without neutralization."}
{"instruction": "Describe the mechanism of acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis.", "response": "Acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis mechanism: 1) Protonation: Carbonyl oxygen is protonated by acid catalyst, making carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. 2) Nucleophilic attack: Water attacks the activated carbonyl carbon, forming tetrahedral intermediate. 3) Proton transfer: Proton shifts within tetrahedral intermediate. 4) Elimination: C-O bond to alkoxy group breaks, alkoxy oxygen picks up proton. 5) Deprotonation: Carboxylic acid loses proton to regenerate catalyst. Overall: ester + water → carboxylic acid + alcohol. Reaction is reversible and reaches equilibrium; excess water drives toward hydrolysis, excess alcohol drives toward esterification."}
{"instruction": "What is the principle behind thin layer chromatography (TLC)?", "response": "TLC separates compounds based on differential migration on a stationary phase. Principle: A sample is spotted on a silica gel or alumina-coated plate (stationary phase). The plate is placed in a developing chamber with mobile phase solvent. Solvent migrates up the plate by capillary action, carrying sample components at different rates based on their polarity and affinity for stationary vs mobile phases. Polar compounds interact more with polar stationary phase (silica/alumina) and migrate slowly. Nonpolar compounds prefer mobile phase and migrate faster. Rf values (retention factor = distance traveled by compound / distance traveled by solvent) characterize each component. Visualization uses UV light, iodine vapor, or chemical stains."}
{"instruction": "How do I set up a reflux apparatus?", "response": "Reflux setup procedure: 1) Select round-bottom flask of appropriate size (fill 1/3 to 2/3 full). 2) Add magnetic stir bar and reaction mixture. 3) Attach condenser vertically to flask using ground glass joint or adapter. Ensure proper seating and secure with clamp. 4) Connect water inlet at bottom of condenser to water source, outlet at top to drain (water flows upward against gravity). 5) Mount apparatus on heating mantle or oil bath using clamp stands. 6) Start water flow through condenser (gentle, steady flow). 7) Begin heating gradually while stirring. 8) Monitor for steady reflux ring formation in condenser. 9) Safety: Never seal system completely - leave top of condenser open or use drying tube. Ensure water connections are secure to prevent flooding."}
{"instruction": "What factors affect reaction rate according to collision theory?", "response": "Collision theory states reaction rate depends on: 1) Concentration: Higher concentration increases collision frequency, increasing rate. Rate ∝ [reactant]^n. 2) Temperature: Higher temperature increases kinetic energy, more molecules exceed activation energy (Ea). Arrhenius equation: k = Ae^(-Ea/RT). Typically 10°C increase doubles rate. 3) Activation energy: Lower Ea means more molecules can react at given temperature. Catalysts lower Ea without being consumed. 4) Molecular orientation: Molecules must collide with proper geometry for reaction. Steric factors affect this. 5) Physical state: Reactions in solution/gas phase generally faster than solid-solid due to better mixing and collision frequency."}
